                        <p>Frogs are  lovable tailess amphibians. They come in many shapes and sizes. Here we have a specific one shown 
                            which is called a Strawberry Pineapple Pacman Frog, His name is Jerry.</p>
                            <img id="Jerry" src="images/Jerry.jpg" alt="An orange frog named Jerry">
                            <p>Like all amphibians, frogs are cold-blooded, meaning their body temperatures change with the temperature of 
                                their surroundings. When temperatures drop, some frogs dig burrows underground or in the mud at the bottom
                                 of ponds. They hibernate in these burrows until spring, completely still and scarcely breathing.</p>
                            <p>This little bad boy right here can eat bugs, Rats, Scorpions, Snakes, Pretty much anything he can fit inside his mouth.</p>
                            <p>Frogs have excellent night vision and are very sensitive to movement. The bulging eyes of most frogs allow them to see
                                in front, to the sides, and partially behind them. When a frog swallows food, it pulls its eyes down into the roof of its mouth,
                                 to help push the food down its throat.</p> 
                            <p>Frogs were the first land animals with vocal cords. Male frogs have vocal sacs—pouches of skin that fill with air. These balloons
                             resonate sounds like a megaphone, and some frog sounds can be heard from a mile away.</p>
                             <p>The vocal sac is the flexible membrane of skin possessed by most male frogs. The purpose of the vocal sac is usually as an
                                  amplification of their mating or advertisement call.</p>

                        <h2>Did You Know?</h2>                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>There is evidence that frogs have roamed the Earth for more than
                                 200 million years, at least as long as the dinosaurs.</li>
                            <li>The world's largest frog is the goliath frog of West Africa—it can
                                 grow to 15 inches and weigh up to 7 pounds. A goliath frog skeleton 
                                 is featured in Frogs: A Chorus of Colors.</li>
                                 <li>One of the smallest is the Cuban tree toad, which grows to half
                                 an inch long.</li>
                                 <li>There are over 5,000 species of frog.</li>
                                 <li>Frogs don't need to drink water as they absorb it through their skin.
                                </li>
                                <li>Although a large amount of frog species live in the water, frogs generally have poor underwater vision. However,
                                     they have adapted to their environment and have eyes that sit above the water allowing frogs to comfortably spend
                                      hours with their bodies submerged to breathe and hide from predators.</li>
                                <li>Frogs have almost a 360° field of vision allowing them to see upwards and backwards. Frogs can therefore sit 
                                    in water with a detailed view of what is going on above, below, and around them to spot food or predators.</li>
                                <li>Frogs also use their eyes and nictitating membranes to swallow food by sucking their eyes down into the roof 
                                    of their mouth after having caught prey. Frogs eat live prey that they catch off guard, swallow whole, and 
                                    suffocate in their stomachs so they use their eyes to push the prey down their esophagus.</li>
                                <li>Frog pupils are generally horizontal or vertical depending on the species and their main activities.
                                         Frogs with horizontal pupils are generally more active during the day, whereas frogs with vertical 
                                         pupils are generally more active at night.</li>
                                <li>Red-Eyed Tree Frogs have red eyes to deter predators. Primary colors generally indicate poison in the wild, 
                                    and although these frogs are not poisonous, their red eyes make them look much less appealing for predators
                                     to eat. </li>
                                <li>A frog's call is unique to its species, and some frog calls can be heard up to a mile away.
                                </li>
                                 <li>Some frogs can jump over 20 times their own body length; that is like a human jumping 30m.
                                </li>
